# Functional Spec: go-llm

## 1. Overview

`go-llm` is a low-level Go client library providing a single, clean, unified
interface to LLM chat providers. It normalizes the request/response model,
streaming, tool use, structured output, reasoning, multimodal input, errors,
and usage accounting across providers, while always leaving an escape hatch to
provider-specific features and raw clients.

It is a **provider client library**, not an agent framework. A future,
separate `go-agent` package will build agent primitives (loops, planning,
memory persistence) on top of go-llm.

Target Go version: **1.26.x** (latest). Streaming uses standard iterators
(`iter`).

## 2. Providers

| Provider | Implementation | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Anthropic | Wraps official `anthropic-sdk-go` | Messages API |
| OpenAI | Wraps official `openai-go` (direct) | **Responses API** — OpenAI's recommended surface for new projects; enables reasoning continuity + content (see provider_capabilities.md) |
| OpenRouter | Shared OpenAI-compatible adapter (via `openai-go`), preset base URL + auth + typed extensions | `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1` |
| ZAI | Shared OpenAI-compatible adapter, preset base URL + auth + typed extensions | `https://api.z.ai/api/paas/v4/` (also coding-plan base URL constant) |
| Custom | Public `Provider` interface — anyone can implement and register their own | |

Decisions:

- **Wrap official SDKs** (`anthropic-sdk-go`, `openai-go`). They are
  well-maintained, updated same-day with API changes, and provide
  battle-tested SSE parsing, retries, and auth. The SDKs are implementation
  details of each provider package; go-llm's public API is its own.
- The core `llm` package (interface + types) has **zero third-party
  dependencies**. SDK dependencies live in provider subpackages
  (`providers/anthropic`, `providers/openai`, `providers/openrouter`,
  `providers/zai`).
- The OpenAI provider targets the **Responses API** (verified July 2026:
  "Responses is recommended for all new projects"; Chat Completions never
  returns reasoning content and discards reasoning between tool-call
  turns). Stateless operation: the adapter sets `store: false` and
  round-trips encrypted reasoning items. Chat Completions remains fully
  supported upstream; legacy-only knobs are reachable via the raw client.
- OpenRouter and ZAI are **presets over one shared OpenAI-compatible
  (chat-completions-shaped) adapter**, each adding typed provider-specific
  options and response mappings (researched from their current docs; see
  §6 and §14). Chat completions is OpenRouter's canonical surface (its
  `/responses` endpoint is beta) and ZAI's only OpenAI-style surface.

## 3. In Scope / Out of Scope

**In scope (v1):**

- Chat/messages (single-shot and multi-turn)
- Streaming
- Tool use / function calling (including parallel tool calls and streaming
  tool-call arguments)
- Structured output (JSON schema + JSON mode)
- Multimodal input: images; PDFs/files where supported
- Reasoning / thinking (unified config + normalized output)
- Prompt caching (unified cache hints + normalized cache usage)
- Retries with backoff; rate-limit awareness (Retry-After)
- Conversation history helper (in-memory message management only)
- Unified errors (normalized top layer + provider cause underneath)
- Normalized usage (tokens) and cost (USD)
- Capabilities discovery
- `Models()` listing of available models per configured provider
- Canonical JSON serialization of messages/responses (persistence-safe;
  reasoning raw payloads survive round-trips) — §10A
- Generic structured-output helper `Parse[T]` with schema-from-struct — §8
- Tool schema generation from Go types + tool-argument validation — §7
- Client-level middleware (chat/stream interceptor seam) — §10B
- Minimal `PromptTemplate` helper (`text/template` wrapper) — §10C
- Observability: `slog` logging, usage-telemetry aggregation, wire-level
  debug capture — §17B
- `llmtest` fake provider for downstream testing — §17A

**Out of scope (v1):**

- Agent loops, planning, tool execution orchestration (→ `go-agent`)
- Embeddings, image generation, audio (TTS/STT)
- Batch APIs (deferred; candidate for v1.x — the `Provider` interface must
  not preclude adding a batch surface later)
- RAG helpers (chunking, vector stores, retrieval glue)
- Prompt-template *machinery* beyond the minimal helper in §10C: template
  registries, versioning, alternate syntaxes (Jinja/f-string), few-shot
  machinery, message splicing (→ `go-agent` / app layer)
- Skills (prompt bundles with progressive disclosure → `go-agent`, which
  needs an agent loop to load them; provider *server-side* skills —
  Anthropic container skills, OpenAI hosted `skills` tool — are reachable
  via provider extensions, shapes too divergent to unify in v1)
- Conversation persistence, summarization, cross-session memory (→ `go-agent`)
- MCP client support (revisit later)
- Provider pricing/catalog maintenance beyond a best-effort, overridable
  price table (see §11)

## 4. Core Model

### 4.1 Provider interface

Every provider implements a small public interface (exact Go signatures in
architecture.md):

- `Name() string` — provider identifier (`"anthropic"`, `"openai"`, …)
- `Capabilities() []Capability` — see §12
- `Models(ctx) ([]ModelInfo, error)` — see §13
- `Chat(ctx, Request) (*Response, error)` — blocking completion
- `ChatStream(ctx, Request) iter.Seq2[Event, error]` — streaming completion

Escape hatch: each provider package exposes its concrete type; a type
assertion gives access to the raw underlying SDK client at runtime
(e.g. `p.(*anthropic.Provider).Client()`).

Interface contract (binding for custom providers too):

- **Goroutine-safe**: a `Provider` must be safe for concurrent use — one
  instance, many goroutines (the wrapped SDK clients already are).
- **Streams are single-use**: the iterator returned by `ChatStream` may
  be ranged once; a second range yields a single `ErrBadRequest`-wrapped
  error, never silent emptiness.
- **No panics**: the library never panics on user input or provider
  behavior; the only panicking functions are the documented `Must*`
  variants.

### 4.2 Request

Unified request fields (all optional unless noted):

- `Model string` — **required**; provider-native model ID passed verbatim
  (no aliasing layer)
- `Messages []Message` — **required**
- `System string` — system prompt text; `SystemCache *CacheHint` optionally
  marks it for provider-side prompt caching (§15)
- `MaxTokens int` — optional; for providers that require it (Anthropic),
  the adapter applies a documented, configurable default (16384) when unset
- `Temperature`, `TopP` — optional pointers (unset ≠ zero); passed through;
  provider-specific range constraints are the provider's problem (errors
  surface normally)
- `StopSequences []string` — capability-gated (`stop-sequences`): the
  OpenAI Responses API has no stop parameter → setting it on OpenAI
  returns `ErrUnsupported`; ZAI caps at 4 entries (pass-through)
- `Tools []Tool`, `ToolChoice` — §7
- `ResponseFormat` — §8
- `Effort` — reasoning/thinking effort level (§9)
- `SessionID string` — session/routing affinity hint (§9A)
- `ProviderOptions` — typed per-provider extension struct (§14)

### 4.3 Messages and content parts

`Message` = role + ordered content parts.

Roles: `user`, `assistant`, `tool` (tool results), `system` (only where a
provider models it as a message; normally use the request-level `System`).

Content part types:

- `Text`
- `Image` — URL or raw bytes + media type
- `File` — document input (PDF etc.) where supported
- `ToolCall` — assistant-issued tool invocation (id, name, JSON arguments)
- `ToolResult` — result for a tool call (tool-call id, content, `IsError`)
- `Reasoning` — reasoning/thinking output; carries normalized text **plus
  opaque raw payload** (e.g. Anthropic thinking-block signatures, OpenRouter
  `reasoning_details`) so multi-turn round-tripping works when messages are
  replayed
- Provider-specific parts (e.g. ZAI `video_url`, `file_url`) via extension

### 4.4 Response

- `Parts []Part` — ordered parts (text, tool calls, reasoning)
- Convenience accessors: `Text()` (concatenated text), `ToolCalls()`
- `StopReason` — normalized (§5)
- `Usage` — normalized (§11)
- `Model string` — the model that actually served the request (matters for
  OpenRouter fallbacks)
- `Raw` — access to the raw provider response; provider packages expose
  typed extras (e.g. OpenRouter's `provider`, `native_finish_reason`,
  annotations)

## 5. Stop Reasons (normalized)

`StopReason` values: `end_turn`, `max_tokens`, `stop_sequence`, `tool_use`,
`content_filter`, `refusal`, `context_overflow`, `paused`, `error`, `other`.
The raw provider value is always preserved alongside.

| Provider raw | Normalized |
|---|---|
| Anthropic `end_turn` / OpenAI `stop` / ZAI `stop` | `end_turn` |
| Anthropic `max_tokens` / OpenAI+ZAI `length` | `max_tokens` |
| Anthropic `stop_sequence` | `stop_sequence` |
| Anthropic `tool_use` / OpenAI+ZAI `tool_calls` | `tool_use` |
| OpenAI `content_filter` / ZAI `sensitive` | `content_filter` |
| Anthropic `refusal` | `refusal` |
| Anthropic + ZAI `model_context_window_exceeded` | `context_overflow` |
| Anthropic `pause_turn` | `paused` |
| OpenRouter `error`, ZAI `network_error` | `error` |
| Anything unrecognized | `other` (raw preserved) |

OpenAI (Responses) has no `finish_reason` — the adapter maps
`status`/`incomplete_details.reason`: `completed` → `end_turn` (or
`tool_use` when `function_call` items are present), `incomplete` +
`max_output_tokens` → `max_tokens`, `incomplete` + `content_filter` →
`content_filter`, `failed` → `error`. The `OpenAI` entries in the table
above are chat-completions vocabulary, which applies to the CC-shaped
adapter (OpenRouter, ZAI).

## 6. Streaming

- `ChatStream` returns an iterator of unified events; errors are yielded
  in-stream (`iter.Seq2[Event, error]`; design rationale in architecture.md).
- Event types: `MessageStart` (id, model), `TextDelta`, `ReasoningDelta`,
  `ToolCallStart` (index, id, name), `ToolCallDelta` (argument JSON
  fragment), `ToolCallEnd`, `MessageEnd` (stop reason + usage).
- A helper (`llm.Collect`) accumulates any stream into a complete
  `*Response`. A text-only consumer adapter, `llm.StreamText`, filters a
  stream to plain text deltas (`iter.Seq2[string, error]`); its
  `WithDebounce(window)` option batches deltas on a time window to
  rate-limit UI re-renders (adopted from fugue-labs/gollem, collapsed to
  one function + options).
- **Per-provider streaming nuances** — normalizing these is a core adapter
  responsibility:

| Provider | Wire format | Nuances the adapter handles |
|---|---|---|
| Anthropic | SSE with typed events (`message_start`, `content_block_start/delta/stop`, `message_delta`, `message_stop`) | Block-indexed deltas (text, `input_json_delta` for tool args, `thinking_delta`); usage on `message_delta`; thinking blocks precede text |
| OpenAI (Responses) | SSE **semantic typed events** (`response.output_text.delta`, `response.function_call_arguments.delta`, `response.reasoning_summary_text.delta`, `response.output_item.added/done`, `response.completed`, …) | Deltas keyed by output-item/content index (no `choices[].delta`); reasoning summary deltas → `ReasoningDelta`; usage arrives on `response.completed`; `response.failed`/`error` events → normalized in-stream error |
| CC-shaped adapter (OpenRouter, ZAI) | SSE `chat.completion.chunk` + `data: [DONE]` | Tool-call deltas indexed via `delta.tool_calls[].index`; `stream_options.include_usage` set where a dialect requires it (OpenRouter auto-includes usage; ZAI includes by default); OpenAI's `obfuscation` chunk field tolerated |
| OpenRouter (dialect specifics) | as CC-shaped row | SSE **comment keep-alives** (`: OPENROUTER PROCESSING`) must be skipped; **mid-stream errors** arrive as an HTTP-200 chunk with `finish_reason: "error"` + `error{}` object → normalized in-stream error; usage+cost auto-included in final chunk; `reasoning`/`reasoning_details` on deltas |
| ZAI (dialect specifics) | as CC-shaped row | Reasoning streams as `delta.reasoning_content` (arrives **before** `delta.content`) → `ReasoningDelta`; tool-argument streaming requires `tool_stream: true` — set automatically when streaming with tools; usage included in final chunk by default |

- Usage always surfaces on the `MessageEnd` event regardless of where the
  provider reports it.
- Cancellation: context cancellation closes the stream and releases the
  connection. (Note: on OpenRouter, upstream billing stops on disconnect
  only for providers that support cancellation — informational, not
  something go-llm can control.)

## 7. Tool Use

- `Tool` = name, description, JSON Schema input (any JSON-marshalable
  value or raw `json.RawMessage`), optional `Strict` flag (mapped to
  Anthropic/OpenAI strict mode where supported).
- **Schema from Go types**: `InputSchema` may be generated from a Go struct
  via the `schema` subpackage — reflection over `json` + ecosystem-standard
  `jsonschema:"description=…,enum=a|b|c,required|optional"` tags (the
  invopop/eino/fugue-convergent convention), with a per-field modifier
  option and a `JSONSchemaer` self-describe hook — emitting the
  strict-mode-compliant subset providers accept. Hand-written JSON Schema
  remains first-class.
- **Argument validation**: an opt-in helper validates model-emitted tool
  arguments against the tool's schema before the caller dispatches them —
  uniform protection against malformed tool calls across providers.
- **Annotations**: optional, MCP-aligned behavioral hints on `Tool`
  (`ReadOnly`, `Destructive`, `Idempotent`, `OpenWorld`). Informational
  only — never sent to providers; consumed by callers (e.g. `go-agent`
  approval policies, MCP interop).
- `ToolChoice`: `auto` | `none` | `required` | `tool(name)`. Capability-gated:
  ZAI supports only `auto`; anything else returns `ErrUnsupported` before any
  network call.
- Parallel tool calls are supported; the conversation helper (§10) appends
  all tool results as a **single** message (an Anthropic API requirement,
  and best practice everywhere).
- Provider-hosted tools (Anthropic server tools, OpenAI Responses hosted
  tools, ZAI `web_search`/`retrieval` tool types, OpenRouter plugins) are
  **not unified** in v1 — they are reachable via provider extensions (§14);
  all four have hosted web search in incompatible shapes (v2 unification
  candidate, see provider_capabilities.md). Anthropic's `pause_turn` from
  server tools is normalized to `StopReason: paused`.

## 8. Structured Output

Two levels, capability-flagged separately:

- `json-schema` — full schema-constrained output: Anthropic
  `output_config.format`, OpenAI `text: {format: json_schema}` (Responses),
  OpenRouter `response_format: json_schema`.
- `json-mode` — valid-JSON-but-unschema'd: ZAI `json_object`.

`ResponseFormat` carries name + schema + strict flag (schema variant) or
JSON-mode marker. Requesting a level a provider lacks → `ErrUnsupported`.
OpenRouter note: schema support varies by upstream provider; the OpenRouter
extension offers `provider.require_parameters` to route only to providers
honoring it.

**Generic helper — `llm.Parse[T]`**: derives the JSON schema from `T` (same
generator as tool schemas), sets `ResponseFormat`, calls the provider, and
unmarshals the response into `T`.

- Mode resolution, best-first (override via `WithParseMode`):
  1. **native** — `json-schema` capability: schema enforced server-side;
  2. **forced-tool extraction** — provider has tools + forced tool choice:
     the schema is bound as a single synthetic tool, tool choice forced,
     and the arguments parsed as the result. The convergent "most
     reliable" pattern across eino and fugue-labs/gollem; useful e.g. on
     OpenRouter when the upstream model lacks schema support;
  3. **json-mode + guidance** — JSON mode plus schema guidance appended to
     the system prompt with client-side validation (ZAI, where tool
     forcing is unavailable).
- Optional bounded retry (`WithParseRetries(n)`, default 0): on
  invalid/unparseable output, the failed turn plus a correction message is
  appended and the request retried, up to `n` times.
- Optional semantic validation (`WithParseValidator(func(T) error)`): a
  validator failure feeds the same bounded retry with the error text.

## 9. Effort (Reasoning / Thinking Control)

Naming decision: the unified knob is called **`Effort`** — it is the common
term across providers (Anthropic `output_config.effort`, OpenAI
`reasoning_effort`, OpenRouter `reasoning.effort`, ZAI `reasoning_effort`).
The *output* is called **`Reasoning`** (majority naming; Anthropic calls it
"thinking").

`Effort` is a single typed enum on the request:

- `""` (zero value) — provider default; nothing is sent
- `none` — reasoning explicitly off
- `minimal` | `low` | `medium` | `high` | `xhigh` | `max`

Mapping:

| Provider | Mapping |
|---|---|
| Anthropic | adaptive thinking + `output_config.effort`; `display` summarized so reasoning content is returned |
| OpenAI | `reasoning: {effort, summary: "auto"}` (Responses) — summaries → `ReasoningPart.Text`, full reasoning items (incl. `encrypted_content`) → `ReasoningPart.Raw` |
| OpenRouter | `reasoning: {effort}` (its `exclude`/`max_tokens` variants live in `openrouter.Options`) |
| ZAI | `thinking: {type: enabled/disabled}` + `reasoning_effort` (GLM-5.2) |

**Per-provider effort level support** (adapters map the unified level to the
nearest supported native level; the table is documented in code):

| Unified level | Anthropic (`output_config.effort`) | OpenAI (`reasoning.effort`, Responses) | OpenRouter (`reasoning.effort`) | ZAI (`reasoning_effort`, GLM-5.2 only) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `minimal` | `low` (nearest) | `minimal` | `minimal` | `minimal` |
| `low` | `low` | `low` | `low` | `low` |
| `medium` | `medium` | `medium` | `medium` | `medium` |
| `high` | `high` | `high` | `high` | `high` |
| `xhigh` | `xhigh` (Opus 4.7+/Sonnet 5/Fable; else `high`) | `xhigh` (gpt-5.2+; older models reject → provider error) | `xhigh` | `xhigh` |
| `max` | `max` (4.6+; else `high`) | `xhigh` (nearest) | `max` | `max` |
| `none` | thinking disabled/omitted | `none` (gpt-5.1+) | `enabled: false` | `thinking: disabled` |

Rules: nearest-level mapping is deterministic and documented; go-llm does
not maintain per-model capability tables — if a *model* rejects a level the
provider error surfaces normally. Reasoning output is normalized to
`Reasoning` parts / `ReasoningDelta` events, with raw payloads preserved for
round-tripping (§4.3).

## 9A. Session Affinity (sticky routing)

A unified request-level `SessionID` provides best-effort routing/cache
affinity across providers — set it once per logical conversation/agent run:

| Provider | Mapping | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| OpenRouter | `session_id` body field | Sticky provider routing across turns |
| OpenAI | `prompt_cache_key` | Cache-hit routing affinity |
| ZAI | `user_id` | Request attribution/affinity (best effort) |
| Anthropic | no-op | Prefix-based caching is automatic; no session key exists |

Capability flag: `session-affinity` (present when the mapping has a real
effect). The field is always safe to set — providers without a mapping
ignore it.

## 10. Conversation History Helper

A minimal in-memory helper (no persistence, no summarization):

- Append user messages
- Append an assistant `*Response` (correctly carrying tool calls and
  reasoning parts, preserving raw payloads for replay)
- Append tool results (grouped into one message)
- Produce `[]Message` for the next request

That is the entire feature. Persistence and memory strategies belong to
`go-agent`.

## 10A. Canonical Serialization

`Message`, `Part`, `Response`, and `Usage` have a **canonical, versioned
JSON encoding** so applications (and `go-agent`) can persist and reload
conversations without inventing their own format:

- Parts serialize with a `"type"` discriminator (`text`, `image`, `file`,
  `tool_call`, `tool_result`, `reasoning`, …).
- The round trip is **lossless for replay**: `ReasoningPart.Raw` and
  `.Provider` survive marshal → unmarshal → marshal byte-identically, so
  same-provider reasoning replay (§18) works on reloaded history.
- Provider extension parts serialize under a namespaced type
  (`"zai/video_url"`); provider packages register their part types for
  decoding.
- An envelope helper encodes `[]Message` with a format `version` field for
  forward migration.
- `Response.Raw` and `Usage.Raw` (in-memory SDK values) are **not**
  serialized — documented; everything normalized is.

## 10B. Middleware

A single, minimal interceptor seam (validated by convergent designs in
eino and gollem):

- `Middleware` provides optional wrappers for `Chat` and `ChatStream`
  (wrapping a stream iterator is a plain function decoration — no teeing
  machinery).
- Applied by **composition**, not provider support:
  `llm.Wrap(provider, mw...)` returns a decorated `Provider`. Adapters know
  nothing about middleware.
- Use cases: tracing, redaction, request mutation, custom policies. For
  logging/telemetry/debugging, go-llm ships stdlib-only built-ins on top
  of this seam and the providers (§17B); third-party integrations
  (OpenTelemetry, metrics backends) build on those.

## 10C. Prompt Templates (minimal)

A deliberately thin, stdlib-only helper over `text/template` for
parameterizing prompts inside the library's own vocabulary:

- `NewPromptTemplate(name, text)` / `MustPromptTemplate` — parses a
  standard `text/template`.
- `Format(vars)` — renders to a string (for `System` or `UserText`);
  **strict**: missing variables error (fail loud, no `<no value>`).
- `Partial(vars)` — returns a new template with some variables pre-bound
  (merged at `Format` time; call-time vars win). Templates are immutable.

Hard scope line: no registry, no versioning, no alternate syntaxes, no
message splicing (history splicing is `History`'s job), no few-shot
machinery — those are `go-agent`/app concerns. This is ergonomics over
`text/template`, nothing more.

## 11. Usage & Cost

Every response (and `MessageEnd` stream event) carries a normalized `Usage`:

- `InputTokens`, `OutputTokens`, `TotalTokens`
- `CacheReadTokens`, `CacheWriteTokens` (zero when unreported)
- `ReasoningTokens` (zero when unreported)
- `CostUSD *float64` — `nil` when unknown
- Raw provider usage accessible underneath

Cost sourcing:

1. **Provider-reported** (OpenRouter reports `usage.cost` in USD on every
   response) — used verbatim.
2. **Estimated** — an optional, user-overridable price table
   (per provider/model: USD per MTok input/output/cache-read/cache-write).
   go-llm ships a best-effort snapshot with a clearly documented snapshot
   date; estimates are marked as estimates. No table entry → `CostUSD` nil.

## 12. Capabilities

- `Capabilities() []Capability` where `Capability` is a typed string.
- Standard constants in core: `streaming`, `tools`, `tool-choice-required`,
  `tool-streaming`, `parallel-tools`, `strict-tools`, `json-schema`,
  `json-mode`, `reasoning`, `image-input`, `pdf-input`, `stop-sequences`,
  `prompt-caching`, `session-affinity`, `cost-reporting`, `models-listing`.
- Provider-specific capabilities are namespaced strings, e.g.
  `openrouter/routing`, `openrouter/plugins`, `zai/web-search-tool`,
  `zai/video-input`.
- Helper `llm.CustomCapabilities(p)` filters to non-standard entries.
- Requests using a capability a provider lacks fail fast with
  `ErrUnsupported` (checked before the network call where determinable).

## 13. Models Listing

`Models(ctx)` returns `[]ModelInfo` — `ID` (always), plus best-effort
`DisplayName`, `ContextWindow`, `MaxOutputTokens`, `Pricing` where the
provider reports them:

- Anthropic: `GET /v1/models` (rich capability data)
- OpenAI: `GET /models` (IDs, minimal metadata)
- OpenRouter: `GET /models` (rich: pricing, context length, modalities)
- ZAI: no documented listing endpoint — returns a curated static list
  shipped with the provider package (documented as such)

## 14. Provider-Specific Extensions

Requests accept a typed, per-provider options struct (carried opaquely by
core; defined in each provider package). Unified fields always win on
conflict. Initial extension surface (from docs research, mid-2026):

**OpenRouter** (`openrouter.Options`):
- `Models []string` (fallback list), `Provider` routing prefs (`order`,
  `only`/`ignore`, `allow_fallbacks`, `require_parameters`, `sort`,
  `max_price`, `quantizations`, `zdr`, …), `Plugins` (web search,
  context-compression), `Prediction`, reasoning variants beyond the unified
  `Effort` (`reasoning.exclude`, `reasoning.max_tokens`), extra sampling
  params (`top_k`, `min_p`, `top_a`, `repetition_penalty`), attribution
  headers (`HTTP-Referer`, `X-Title`).
- Response extras: `provider`, `native_finish_reason`, `cost_details`,
  `annotations` (web citations), `reasoning_details`.
- Deliberately **not** exposed (deprecated upstream): `transforms`,
  `usage: {include}`.

**ZAI** (`zai.Options`):
- `Thinking` (`clear_thinking`), `DoSample`, `ToolStream`, `RequestID`,
  `UserID`; non-standard tool types (`web_search`, `retrieval`); extra
  content parts (`video_url`, `file_url`); base URL selection (general vs
  coding-plan endpoint; Anthropic-compatible endpoint constant provided).
- Response extras: `request_id`, `web_search[]` results.

**Anthropic** (`anthropic.Options`): beta headers, provider-native fields not
in the unified surface (e.g. fine-grained cache TTLs beyond the unified
hint, service tiers), raw SDK access via `Client()`.

**OpenAI** (`openai.Options`): Responses-specific pass-through — `store`
(go-llm defaults it to `false`), `previous_response_id` / `conversation`,
`include`, `background`, hosted tools (web_search, file_search,
code_interpreter, computer_use, image_generation, remote MCP, shell,
skills, apply_patch, tool_search), `verbosity`,
`metadata`, `service_tier`, `safety_identifier`, `prompt_cache_retention`;
raw SDK access via `Client()` (which also reaches Chat Completions for
legacy-only knobs: `n`, `seed`, `logit_bias`, `logprobs`, penalties, audio,
`prediction`).

## 15. Prompt Caching

- Unified: an optional `CacheHint` on content parts / system prompt
  (with optional TTL). Providers with explicit breakpoints honor it
  (Anthropic `cache_control`; OpenRouter passes `cache_control` through to
  Anthropic-family models). Providers with automatic caching (OpenAI, ZAI)
  ignore the hint.
- Cache effectiveness is always observable via `Usage.CacheReadTokens` /
  `CacheWriteTokens`.

## 16. Errors

Two layers, always:

1. **Normalized sentinel errors** (match with `errors.Is`): `ErrAuth`,
   `ErrPermission`, `ErrNotFound` (bad model/endpoint), `ErrBadRequest`,
   `ErrRateLimited`, `ErrInsufficientCredits` (OpenRouter 402),
   `ErrOverloaded`, `ErrServer`, `ErrTimeout`, `ErrContentFiltered`,
   `ErrContextTooLong`, `ErrUnsupported` (capability mismatch),
   plus standard `context.Canceled`/`DeadlineExceeded` pass-through.
2. **Provider cause** (match with `errors.As`): `*llm.ProviderError` with
   `Provider`, `HTTPStatus`, `Code` (string — handles OpenAI error types,
   OpenRouter numeric codes, ZAI numeric-string business codes),
   `Message`, `RetryAfter`, `Metadata`, and the raw body.

Mapping notes from research: ZAI uses numeric-string business codes
(1000/1001/1003 auth → `ErrAuth`; 1261 → `ErrContextTooLong`; 1301 →
`ErrContentFiltered`; 1302 → `ErrRateLimited`; 1308+ → quota); OpenRouter
403 moderation carries structured metadata (surfaced via `ProviderError`);
mid-stream errors normalize identically to pre-stream errors.

## 17. Configuration & Operations

- Per-provider constructors with functional options: `WithAPIKey` (env-var
  fallback: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`,
  `ZAI_API_KEY`), `WithBaseURL`, `WithHTTPClient`, `WithMaxRetries`,
  `WithTimeout`.
- Retries: delegated to the wrapped SDKs where available; the shared
  adapter retries 408/429/5xx and connection errors with exponential
  backoff, honoring `Retry-After`. Default max retries: 2 (SDK convention).
- All calls take `context.Context`; no global state.
- go-llm **never reads configuration files** — credentials come from
  explicit options or environment variables only. (The repository's own
  live e2e suite reads a gitignored `gollm-test.json` for test keys — a
  test-harness convention, not library behavior; see architecture §9.)

## 17A. Testing Support (`llmtest`)

A small `llmtest` package ships a scriptable fake `Provider` so downstream
code (and `go-agent`) can be tested offline:

- Enqueue canned responses, canned event streams, or errors — consumed in
  order by `Chat`/`ChatStream`.
- Records every received `*Request` for assertions.
- Configurable `Name`/`Capabilities` to exercise capability-gated paths.
- Implements the full `Provider` interface — it is also a permanent
  dogfooding check that the interface stays implementable outside the
  built-in providers.

## 17B. Observability: Logging, Telemetry, Debugging

Three layers — all stdlib-only, all **silent by default**, no globals:

**Logging (`log/slog`).** Every provider constructor accepts
`WithLogger(*slog.Logger)`. With a logger set, adapters log: call
summaries at `Debug` (provider, model, duration, stop reason, usage,
request id where available), retries and rate-limit waits at `Warn`,
request failures at `Error`. No logger (the default) = fully silent.

**Telemetry (usage aggregation).** `llm.NewUsageTracker()` returns a
goroutine-safe aggregator whose `Middleware()` plugs into `llm.Wrap`:
per provider/model — call counts, success/error counts, token sums
(input/output/cache read+write/reasoning), cost sums, durations. Streams
are covered (usage observed on `MessageEnd`). `Stats()` returns a
snapshot suitable for feeding any metrics system. OpenTelemetry and
metrics-backend *integrations* are deliberately not in core — the
tracker, middleware seam, and wire capture are their raw material.
Budget **enforcement** (halting/refusing calls once a token or cost cap
is hit) is workload policy → `go-agent`; it composes as a few-line
middleware over `UsageTracker.Stats()`, and Anthropic's server-side task
budgets remain reachable via `anthropic.Options`. go-llm's job is that
the numbers are always accurate and available; spending decisions belong
to the caller.

**Debugging (wire capture / trace mode).** Every provider constructor
accepts `WithDebugCapture(fn func(WireCapture))` — a transport-level tap
beneath the SDK that hands the callback the exact HTTP exchange per
attempt: method, URL, redacted request headers, request body, status,
response headers, buffered response body (SSE streams included), timing,
and transport error. Sensitive headers (`Authorization`, `x-api-key`,
cookies) are **always redacted** — not optional. Each SDK retry attempt
is captured separately. `llm.DebugToLogger(l)` adapts a logger into a
capture fn (full payloads at `Debug`) for instant trace mode. Bodies may
contain user data — storage/retention is the application's
responsibility.

## 18. Edge Cases & Behaviors

- **Feature/provider mismatch** → `ErrUnsupported` before the network call
  when statically determinable (e.g. `ToolChoice: required` on ZAI).
- **Refusals** (Anthropic) → `StopReason: refusal`; content may be empty or
  partial; callers must check stop reason before reading content — the
  `Text()` accessor returns `""` safely.
- **OpenRouter warm-up empty choices** (HTTP 200, no content) → normalized
  to `ErrServer` (retryable).
- **Reasoning round-trip**: replaying history containing `Reasoning` parts
  re-emits the preserved raw payloads for the same provider; other providers
  receive only what their API accepts (raw payloads dropped).
- **OpenAI statelessness**: the adapter always sends `store: false` +
  `include: ["reasoning.encrypted_content"]` — no server-side conversation
  state unless explicitly opted into via `openai.Options`. Encrypted
  reasoning items round-trip through `ReasoningPart.Raw`, giving OpenAI
  turn-to-turn reasoning continuity in tool loops with zero stored state.
- **Tool-call arguments** are always parsed/emitted as JSON — no raw string
  matching guarantees (providers vary in escaping).
- **Sampling range differences** (e.g. ZAI temperature ∈ [0,1]) are passed
  through; provider validation errors surface via the normalized error
  layer. go-llm does not silently clamp.
- **Verbatim model IDs**: no validation of model names client-side;
  unknown model → provider's `ErrNotFound`/`ErrBadRequest`.
- **Single-choice contract**: go-llm always requests and consumes exactly
  one completion choice (`n` is not part of the unified surface; adapters
  read choice 0).
